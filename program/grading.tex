80\% progress is required throughout the program. Assignments will be graded for their timeliness
and quality. If an assignment is submitted on time and fulfills all requirements to the satisfaction
of the instructor, it will receive full points. If it is late, it will be docked 20\%. Students will
be able to resubmit their work at any time for regrading and can receive full points, but after it is
late, they cannot receive more than 80\%.

For example, say an assignment is worth 10 points, and a student submits it on time but fails some of the
automated tests. They might receive 7/10 points. They fix their mistakes and resubmit before the due date
and pass all of the tests. They would receive 10/10 points. If they had waited till after the due date to
resubmit their fixes, they would have received 8/10 points.

Dixie Techical College Full Stack Web Development program does not issue letter grades for adult learners; we are
a competency based learning program. That means that your progress is based on the skills you acquire
and demonstrate in each course. If you need a letter grade, we will issue a suggested letter grade based
on the standard grading scale.
