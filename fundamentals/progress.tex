Progress is based on the quality and amount of work you complete in the classroom. While we
encourage daily attendance, you must meet a minimum of 80\% progress and 80\% attendance to
maintain satisfactory progress. Students that fall below progress requirements will be placed on
academic probation and could be dropped from the course and program.

Progress and attendance reports will be given monthly, or can be requested from the instructor during
office hours. In order to pass a module, every assignment in the module must be passed off and the
module assessment must be completed.
