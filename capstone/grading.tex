Dixie Tech Full Stack Web Development program does not issue letter grades for adult learners; we are
a competency based learning program. That means that your progress is based on the skills you acquire
and demonstrate in each course. If you need a letter grade, we will issue a suggested letter grade based
on the standard grading scale.
